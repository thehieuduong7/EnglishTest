Dear Helen,\nI would like to congratulate you on organising such an excellent and informative workshop. \nI know a lot of people learnt a great deal from it.  Can you pass on my thanks to Doctor Friedman \nfor his fascinating talk on Staff Motivation?  I realise how lucky we were that he was able to find\nthe time for us.  The feedback from the staff was very positive.  \nLet’s hope we actually see an improvement in staff motivation as a result!\nBy the way, I’m missing my list of addresses of the delegates who attended.  Did I happen to leave it in your office?  It’s just that I haven’t seen it since our meeting on Friday.\nThanks again for a great day,\nAnne
